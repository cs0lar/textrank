			R. Mihalcea, P. Tarau, 2004

		Parameters:
		-----------
		
			N - the size of the window, in lexical units (e.g. words, sentences) that defines 
				the co-occurrence relation. Default is 2, i.e. a window that comprises the target 
				token as well as the two logical units either side of it.

			pos - an array of syntactic filters, codes for the parts of speech that are to be considered 
				  nodes of the graph (e.g. only use nouns and verbs). Default is noun and adjectives.
			
			T - the number of top ranked lexical units to return. It T is not specified, T defaults to a third of the vertices in the graph
